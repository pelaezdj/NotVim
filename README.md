I'm not a programmer by trade but I'd like to share my nonsense.

Here is a ".vimrc" that makes Vim behave like a typical text editor. Why would one want this? I dunno but I personally want something better than Nano but worse than stock Vim.

It behaves like one would typically expect. Ctrl+S is save, Ctrl+C is copy, navigate with arrow keys, etc.

Ctrl+L will allow one to type in "colon commands"

WARNING: if you must run this in a TTY, open tmux first.

Have fun!
